## 📖 Project Overview
Al-Sabeel (The Path) is an educational platform offering interactive learning roadmaps for software development and technology fields. This project provides structured learning paths that organize programming knowledge into clear progression levels (Basic, Beyond Basic, Advanced) with curated resources for each topic.

## 💡 The Vision
This project was born from observing the challenges faced by programming newcomers in today's vast technological landscape: scattered resources, unclear learning paths, and difficulty prioritizing concepts. Drawing inspiration from Islamic values where knowledge is a sacred light, this project aims to create an accessible, organized learning journey that honors our Arab-Islamic heritage of scientific excellence.

**يَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ**  
*"Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees."*
